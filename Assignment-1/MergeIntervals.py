Merge Intervals:
Given a list of integer pairs representing the low and high end of an interval, 
inclusive, return a list in which overlapping intervals are merged.

Time Complexity: O(nlogn) => n for size of intervals; logn for sorting intervals
Space Complexity: O(n) => size of result has a max length of number of intervals

Technique: 
Sort, then solve

Time Spent:
30 minutes

Approach:
1) Sort intervals by first value in tuple
2) Store first interval in result
3) Iterate through sorted intervals and get the previous interval.
    - If the current start value is less than or equal to the previous end value, intervals overlap. Merge.
    - Otherwise, intervals don't overlap. Append interval to result.
4) Return tuple (not list) of intervals
