Missing Integer:
Given an integer n and a sorted array of integers of size n-1 which contains
all but one of the integers in the range 1-n, find the missing integer.

Time Complexity: O(n) => iterating through entire array
Space Complexity: O(1) => not storing extra memory

Technique:
Brute force. Can do it in O(logn)?

Time Spent:
15 minutes

Approach:
1) Iterate through array using range based for loop
2) If i doesn't equate to missing integer in array, return that value. Set found to True
3) If haven't found missing integer after full integer, return length of array, n
