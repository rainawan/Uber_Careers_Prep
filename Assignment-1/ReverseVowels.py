Reverse Vowels:
Given a string, reverse the order of the vowels in the string.

Time Complexity: O(n) => iterating through word twice equates to O(2n)
Space Complexity: O(n) => creating a list fo the word, stack, and vowels equates to O(3n)

Technique: 
Stack

Time Spent:
35 minutes

Approach:
Iterate through word and push all vowels into a stack
Iterate through word again. Upon finding vowel, replace it with top of stack. Pop stack
