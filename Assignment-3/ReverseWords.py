Reverse Words:
Given a string, return the string with the order of the space-separated words reversed

Time Complexity: O(n) => Going through all the letters in the input to find words
Space Complexity: O(n) => Adding all letters to stack

Technique:
Stack

Time Spent:
25 minutes

Approach:
1) Separate input string into whole words using split().
2) Add words into stack.
3) Pop top of stack and append to result list.
