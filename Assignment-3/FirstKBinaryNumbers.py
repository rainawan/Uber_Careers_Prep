First K Binary Numbers:
Given a number, k, return an array of the first k binary numbers, represented as strings.

Time Complexity: O(k) => queue appends values k number of times
Space Complexity: O(k) => adding k string elements to result

Technique:
Breadth-first search

Time Spent:
40 minutes (could not figure out DFS solution)

Approach:
1) Create a queue of values, adding 0 and 1 (in that order) for each iteration.
2) As long as the result has not reached a length of k, pop the leftmost value and append it to res.
