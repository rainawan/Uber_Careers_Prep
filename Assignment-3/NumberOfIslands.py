Number of Islands:
Given a binary matrix in which 1s represent land and 0s represent water. 
Return the number of islands (contiguous 1s surrounded by 0s or the edge of the matrix).

Time Complexity: O(m x n) => have to visit every box in the grid
Space Complexity: O(1) => only storing number of islands

Technique:
Depth-first search

Time Spent:
30 minutes

Approach:
1) Visit every box in the grid until a 1 (land) is reached
2) Find all neighboring 1s by marking visited 1s
3) Increment the number of islands
