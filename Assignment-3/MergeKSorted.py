Merge K Sorted Arrays:
Given an array of k sorted arrays, merge the k arrays into a single sorted array.

Time Complexity: O(k logn) => insertion operation for heap is O(log n). There are k arrays
Space Complexity: O(k) => heap contains k arrays

Technique:
Heap

Time Spent:
25 minutes

Approach:
1) Push all elements from arrays into one list
2) Pop the minimum element using heappop and add to res
