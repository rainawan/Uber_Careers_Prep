Vacation Destinations:
Given an origin city, a maximum travel time k, and pairs of destinations that can be reached directly 
from each other with corresponding travel times in hours, return the number of destinations within k 
hours of the origin. Assume that having a stopover in a city adds an hour of travel time.

Time Complexity: O(E*log(V^2)) => Traversing cities where every path has two cities 
Space Complexity: O(E + V) => Creating map of cities (vertices) and paths (edges)

Technique: 
BFS Graph Traversal

Time Spent:
40 minutes

Approach:
1) Create map where key is origin city and value is (destination, distance).
2) Create queue, appending the origin and current distance travelled.
3) Visit neighboring cities, adding the respective distance. Add new cities to res.
4) Continue until distance exceeds k
