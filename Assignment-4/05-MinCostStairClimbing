Minimum Cost Stair Climbing:
You can only climb one or two stairs at once. The last stair you step on can be either 
stair n-1 or n-2. Given an array representing the costs per stair, what is the minimum 
possible toll you can pay to climb the staircase?

Time Complexity: O(n) => iterating through stairs backwards
Space Complexity: O(1)

Time Spent:
25 minutes
